##  Car Fueling
Compute the minimum number of tank refills to get from one city to another.
Assuming that the distance between the cities is 1≤d≤1051≤d≤105 miles, a car can travel at most 1≤m≤4001≤m≤400 miles on a full tank, and there are 1≤n≤3001≤n≤300 gas stations at distances stop1,stop2,…,stopnstop1,stop2,…,stopn along the way, output the minimum number of refills needed. Assume that the car starts with a full tank. If it is not possible to reach the destination, output −1. The distances to gas stations satisfy the inequalities 
0<stop1<stop2<⋯<stopn<d.
